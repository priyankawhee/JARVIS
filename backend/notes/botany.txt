Botany Notes

1. Introduction:
   - Botany is the branch of biology that deals with the scientific study of plants.
   - It includes structure, properties, and biochemical processes of plants, as well as plant classification, diseases, and interactions with the environment.

2. Plant Structure:
   - Root System: Absorbs water and nutrients, anchors the plant.
   - Shoot System: Consists of stems, leaves, and flowers.
   - Leaves: Main site for photosynthesis.
   - Flowers: Reproductive organs producing seeds.

3. Photosynthesis:
   - Process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy.
   - Equation: 6CO2 + 6H2O + light → C6H12O6 + 6O2.
   - Chlorophyll captures light energy in chloroplasts.

4. Plant Classification:
   - Algae, Bryophytes, Pteridophytes, Gymnosperms, Angiosperms.
   - Based on presence of vascular tissue and seed formation.

5. Plant Hormones:
   - Auxins, Gibberellins, Cytokinins, Ethylene, Abscisic Acid.
   - Regulate growth, flowering, fruiting, and dormancy.

6. Importance:
   - Provides oxygen, food, shelter, medicine, and maintains ecological balance.
