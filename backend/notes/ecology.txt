Ecology Notes

1. Introduction:
   - Ecology studies interactions among organisms and their environment.

2. Levels of Organization:
   - Individual → Population → Community → Ecosystem → Biosphere.

3. Ecosystem Components:
   - Biotic: Living organisms (plants, animals, microbes).
   - Abiotic: Non-living components (light, temperature, soil, water).

4. Energy Flow:
   - Producers → Consumers → Decomposers.
   - Energy transfer follows the 10% rule in trophic levels.

5. Biogeochemical Cycles:
   - Water, Carbon, Nitrogen, and Oxygen cycles maintain balance in nature.

6. Environmental Issues:
   - Deforestation, Pollution, Global Warming, Loss of Biodiversity.

7. Conservation:
   - Sustainable practices, Wildlife protection, Reforestation, Recycling.
