Genetics Notes

1. Introduction:
   - Genetics is the study of heredity and variation in living organisms.

2. Mendelian Genetics:
   - Gregor Mendel’s experiments on pea plants established inheritance laws:
     - Law of Segregation
     - Law of Independent Assortment
     - Law of Dominance

3. DNA and RNA:
   - DNA: Deoxyribonucleic acid; carries genetic code.
   - RNA: Ribonucleic acid; involved in protein synthesis (mRNA, tRNA, rRNA).

4. Chromosomes and Genes:
   - Chromosomes carry genes; humans have 23 pairs.
   - Genes are segments of DNA responsible for traits.

5. Modern Genetics:
   - Genome Sequencing, Genetic Engineering, CRISPR-Cas9.
   - Applications in medicine, agriculture, and forensics.

6. Genetic Disorders:
   - Down Syndrome, Hemophilia, Cystic Fibrosis, Sickle Cell Anemia.
