1. Introduction:
   - Biology is the study of living organisms and their interactions with the environment.

2. Branches:
   - Botany: Study of plants.
   - Zoology: Study of animals.
   - Microbiology: Study of microorganisms.
   - Genetics: Study of heredity and variation.

3. Cell Biology:
   - Cell is the basic unit of life.
   - Types: Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic cells.
   - Cell Organelles: Nucleus, Mitochondria, Ribosomes, Chloroplasts.

4. Genetics:
   - DNA carries genetic information.
   - Mendelian Inheritance: Dominant and Recessive traits.
   - Modern genetics includes gene editing (CRISPR-Cas9).
