Deep Learning Notes

1. Introduction:
   - Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers.
   - It mimics the human brain in processing data and creating patterns for decision making.

2. Key Concepts:
   - Neural Networks: Made up of neurons (nodes) organized in layers.
   - Activation Functions: Sigmoid, ReLU, Tanh.
   - Backpropagation: Algorithm for training neural networks.
   - Loss Functions: Mean Squared Error, Cross Entropy.

3. Architectures:
   - CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks): Used for image data.
   - RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks): Used for sequential data.
   - LSTM and GRU: Variants of RNN for long-term dependencies.
   - Transformer: Used in NLP (BERT, GPT).

4. Frameworks:
   - TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras.

5. Applications:
   - Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Speech Recognition, Autonomous Systems.
